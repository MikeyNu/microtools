# Duplicate Navbar Fix - Complete

## Issue
Multiple category pages had duplicate navbars appearing when users clicked on category tabs from the homepage. This was caused by hardcoded `<header>` elements in individual category pages, which conflicted with the global navbar in `app/layout.tsx`.

## Pages Fixed
All of the following category pages had their duplicate navbars removed:

### ✅ Fixed Category Pages (10 total):
1. **app/text-tools/page.tsx** - Text Tools category
2. **app/text-utilities/page.tsx** - Text Utilities category
3. **app/calculators/page.tsx** - Calculators category
4. **app/developer-tools/page.tsx** - Developer Tools category
5. **app/timestamp-tools/page.tsx** - Timestamp Tools category
6. **app/web-tools/page.tsx** - Web Tools category
7. **app/seo-tools/page.tsx** - SEO Tools category
8. **app/pdf-tools/page.tsx** - PDF Tools category
9. **app/image-tools/page.tsx** - Image Tools category
10. **app/design-tools/page.tsx** - Design Tools category

### ✅ Previously Fixed:
11. **app/tools/page.tsx** - All Tools page (fixed earlier)

### ✅ No Duplicate Found:
- **app/converters/page.tsx** - Already had no duplicate navbar

## What Was Removed
Each page had a hardcoded header section like this:
```tsx
<header className="border-b border-border/10 bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-xl">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-6 py-5">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <Link href="/" className="flex items-center space-x-4">
        // ... logo and branding
      </Link>
      <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center space-x-8">
        // ... navigation links
      </nav>
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
```

## Solution
Removed all hardcoded `<header>` elements from category pages. The global navbar from `app/layout.tsx` now provides consistent navigation across all pages without duplication.

## Benefits
✅ Single navbar on all pages  
✅ Consistent navigation experience  
✅ Easier maintenance (one navbar to update)  
✅ Better UX with mobile menu auto-close on route change  
✅ Cleaner code with less duplication  

## Testing
- Build process completed successfully with no errors
- All category pages now use the global navbar from layout
- Mobile menu properly closes when navigating between pages
